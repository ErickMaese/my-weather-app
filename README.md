# Weather App
This is a simple weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather information for a given location.

## Usage
To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be prompted to enter a city or location. After entering a location, the app will display the current weather information for that location, including the temperature, weather condition, and wind speed.

## Dependencies
This app requires an active internet connection and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. No additional libraries or frameworks are required.

## Acknowledgements
This app was built as a simple demonstration of how to use APIs to retrieve and display data in a web application. It is not intended to be a fully-featured weather app, but rather a starting point for further development.
